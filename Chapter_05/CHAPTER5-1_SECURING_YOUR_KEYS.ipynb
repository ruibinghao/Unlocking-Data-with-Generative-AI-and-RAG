Understanding RAG: Basics and Principles#\\nModern day large language models (LLM) are impressive, but they have never seen your company’s private data (hopefully!). This means the ability of an LLM to help your company fully utilize its own data is very limited. This very large barrier has given rise to the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where you are using the power and capabilities of the LLM, but combining it with the knowledge and data contained within your company’s internal data repositories. This is the primary motivation for using RAG, to make new data available to the LLM and significantly increase the value you can extract from that data. Beyond internal data, it is also useful in cases where the LLM has not been trained on the data, even if it is public, like the most recent research papers or articles about a topic that is strategic to your company. In both cases, we are talking about data that was not present during the training of the LLM. You can have the latest LLM trained on the most tokens ever, exceeding 10 trillion, but if that data was not present for the training, then the LLM will be at a disadvantage to help you reach your full productivity. Ultimately, this highlights the fact that for most organizations, connecting to data an LLM is not yet familiar with is a central need for them to fully utilize that LLM. RAG is the most popular paradigm for doing this. This book focuses on showing you how to set up a RAG application with your data, as well as how to get the most out of it in various situations. I intend to give you an in-depth understanding of RAG and its importance in leveraging LLM within the context of a company's private or specific data needs. Advantages of RAG#\\nPotential advantages of using RAG include improved accuracy and relevance, customization, flexibility, and expanding the model’s knowledge beyond the training data. Here is each advantage more thoroughly explored:\\n\\nImproved Accuracy and Relevance: RAG can significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses that are generated by large language models (LLMs). RAG fetches and incorporates specific information from a database or dataset, typically in real time, and ensures that the output is based on both the model’s pre-existing knowledge and the most current and relevant data that you are providing directly. Customization and Flexibility: RAG can customize its responses based on your domain specific needs. By integrating a company's internal databases into the model's response generation process, RAG allows for outputs that are tailored to the unique context and requirements of the business. This level of customization is invaluable for creating personalized experiences and for applications requiring a high degree of specificity and detail. Expanding Model Knowledge Beyond Training Data: LLMs are limited by the scope of their training data. RAG overcomes this limitation by enabling models to access and utilize information that was not included in their initial training sets. This effectively expands the knowledge base of the model without the need for retraining, making LLMs more versatile and adaptable to new domains or rapidly evolving topics. Limitations of RAG#\\nBut there are some limitations to using RAG, which include dependency on the quality of the internal data, computational overhead, more complex integrations, and the potential for information overload. Dependency on Data Quality: \\nWhen talking about how data can impact an AI model, the saying in data science circles is “garbage in, garbage out.”  Meaning, if you give a model bad data, it will give you bad results. RAG is no different. The effectiveness of RAG is directly tied to the quality of the data it retrieves. If the underlying database or dataset contains outdated, biased, or inaccurate information, the outputs generated by RAG will likely suffer from the same issues. Need for Data Manipulation and Cleaning:\\nData in the recesses of the company often has a lot of value to it, but it is not often in good, accessible shape. For example, data from PDF-based customer statements needs a lot of massaging to get into a format that can be useful to a RAG pipeline. Computational Overhead: \\nA RAG pipeline introduces a host of new computational steps into the response generation process, including data retrieval, processing, and integration. LLMs are getting faster every day, but even the fastest response can be more than a second, and some can take several seconds. If you combine that with other data processing steps, and possibly multiple LLM calls, the result can be a very significant increase in the time it takes to receive a response. This all leads to increased computational overhead, affecting the efficiency and scalability of the entire system. As with any other IT initiative, an organization must balance the benefits of enhanced accuracy and customization against the resource requirements and potential latency introduced by these additional processes. Data Storage Explosion: Complexity in Integration and Maintenance: \\nTraditionally, your data resides in a data source which is queried in various ways to be made available to your internal and external systems. But with RAG, your data resides in multiple forms and locations, such as vectors in a vector database, that represent the same data, but in a different format. Add in the complexity of connecting these various data sources to LLMs and relevant technical mechanisms like vector searches, and you have a significant increase in complexity. This increased complexity can be resource-intensive.\"),\n",
              "  Document(metadata={'source': 'https://kbourne.github.io/chapter1.html'}, page_content=\"Vectors, Vectors, Vectors! A vector is a mathematical representation of your data. They are often referred to as the embeddings when talking specifically about natural language processing and LLMs. Vectors are one of the most important concepts to understand and there are many different parts of a RAG pipeline that utilize vectors. I felt it was bigger than just a quick definition, so I go into much more depth in the much larger next section dedicated to vectors. And beyond that, we literally spend two chapters (6 & 7) going over vectors and how they are used to find similar content. Vectors#\\nIt could be argued that understanding vectors and all the ways they are used in RAG is the most important part of this entire book. As mentioned above, vectors are simply the mathematical representations of your external data, and they are often referred to as embeddings. These representations capture semantic information in a format that can be processed by algorithms, facilitating tasks such as similarity search, which is a crucial step in the RAG process. Vectors typically have a specific dimension based on how many numbers are represented by them. For example, this is a 4 dimensional vector: [0.123, 0.321, 0.312, 0.231]\\n\\nIf you didn’t know we were talking about vectors and you saw this in Python code, you might recognize this as a list of 4 floating points, and you aren’t too far off. Typically though, when working with vectors in Python, you actually want to recognize them as a Numpy Array. Numpy Arrays are generally more machine learning friendly because they are optimized to be processed much faster and efficiently than python lists, and they are more broadly recognized as the defacto representation of embeddings across machine learning packages like SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, and many others. Numpy also enables you to perform vectorized math directly on the Numpy Array, such as performing element-wise operations, without having to code in loops and other approaches you might have to use if using a different type of sequence. When working with vectors for vectorization, they are often hundreds, or thousands of dimensions, which refers to the number of floating points present in the vector. So a 1024 dimension vector literally has 1024 floating points in a Numpy Array. Higher dimensionality can capture more detailed semantic information, which is crucial for accurately matching query inputs with relevant documents or data in RAG applications. In chapter 7, we cover the key role vectors and vector databases play In RAG implementation. And then in chapter 8, we will dive more into the concept of similarity searches, which utilize vectors to conduct the search much faster and efficiently. These are key concepts that will help you gain a much deeper understanding into how to better implement a RAG pipeline. Implementing RAG in AI Applications#\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of GenAI platforms in the corporate world. RAG combines the power of information retrieval of internal or “new” data with generative language models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text. This technique can be particularly useful for companies across various industries to improve their products, services, and operational efficiencies. Some examples of how RAG can be used include:\\n Customer Support and Chatbots - These can exist without RAG, but when integrated with RAG, it can connect those chatbots with past customer interactions, FAQs, support documents, and anything else that was specific to that customer. Automated Reporting - RAG can assist in creating initial drafts or summarizing existing articles, research papers, and other types of unstructured data into more digestible formats. Product Descriptions - For e-commerce companies, RAG can be used to help generate or enhance product descriptions by retrieving information from similar products or manufacturer specifications. Searchability and Utility of Internal Knowledge Bases - RAG can improve access to internal knowledge bases. This can be achieved through the generation of summaries of documents or by providing direct answers to queries based on the content of internal documents, emails, and other resources. Searchability and Utility of General Knowledge Bases - In areas like legal and compliance, where companies need to have an understanding of a massive and growing general knowledge base, RAG can be implemented to retrieve and summarize relevant laws, regulations, and compliance documents. Other areas where this is applicable include research and development, medical, academia, patents, and technical documents. Innovation Scouting - Similar to searching general knowledge bases, but with a focus on new innovation, companies can use RAG to scan and summarize information from quality sources to identify trends and potential areas for new innovations that are relevant to that company's specialization. Content Personalization - RAG can be used by media and content platforms to personalize content recommendations or create customized summaries by retrieving information based on a user's past interactions and preferences. Product Recommendations - RAG can be used by e-commerce sites to enhance product recommendation engines, generate personalized descriptions, or highlight features based on the browsing and purchasing history of customers. Training and Education - RAG can be used by education organizations and corporate training programs to generate or customize learning materials based on specific needs and knowledge levels of the learners. With RAG, a much deeper level of internal knowledge from the organization can be incorporated into the educational curriculum in very customized ways to the individual or role. This book will help you understand how you can implement all of these game-changing initiatives in your company. Comparing RAG with Conventional Generative AI#\\nConventional Generative AI has already shown to be a revolutionary change for companies, helping their employees reach new levels of productivity. LLMs like ChatGPT are assisting users with a rapidly growing list of applications that include writing business plans, writing and improving code, writing marketing copy, and even providing healthier recipes for a specific type of diet. Ultimately, much of what users are doing is getting done faster.\")],\n",
